## Usage Guide

### Calculating Leave

1. **Select Leave Type**: Choose from available leave types
2. **Enter Details**:
   - **Vacation Leave**: Select your Grade Level (GL)
   - **Maternity Leave**: Uses fixed 112 working days
   - **Other Leaves**: Enter desired number of days
3. **Choose Start Date**: Select when your leave begins
4. **Calculate**: Click "Calculate Leave" to get results

### Managing Public Holidays

1. **View Current Holidays**: See all recognized public holidays
2. **Add Holiday**: Use the "Add Holiday" button to add custom holidays
3. **Remove Holiday**: Click the delete icon and confirm removal
4. **Refresh from API**: Use "Refresh" to fetch latest holidays from API

### Results Interpretation

- **Leave Expiration Date**: Last day of your leave
- **Resumption Date**: First working day after leave ends
- **Skipped Holidays**: Public holidays that occurred during your leave
- **Total Working Days**: Actual working days calculated

## Core Calculation Logic

The application follows this logic for leave calculation:

1. Start from the selected start date
2. Count only working days (Monday-Friday, excluding public holidays)
3. Skip weekends and public holidays without counting them
4. Continue until the required number of working days is reached
5. Calculate resumption as the next working day after leave expiration
